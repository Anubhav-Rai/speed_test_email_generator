First setup a mail server on local system

steps:-

first install

sudo apt update sudo apt install postfix mailutils

During the installation on Debian/Ubuntu, you might be prompted to choose a configuration type. Select "Internet Site".

Step 2: Configure Postfix Open the main Postfix configuration file with your preferred text editor. Here, nano is used for demonstration:

sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf

Add or modify the following lines to configure Postfix as a send-only mail server:

myhostname = your_server_domain_or_IP myorigin = /etc/mailname mydestination = relayhost = mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::1]/128 inet_interfaces = loopback-only inet_protocols = ipv4

myhostname: Set this to your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address if you don't have a domain. myorigin: This is used as the domain name in the "From" field of outgoing emails. Debian/Ubuntu systems automatically configure /etc/mailname during installation. mydestination: Leave this empty to prevent Postfix from trying to deliver emails locally. relayhost: Leave this empty unless you're using an external SMTP server to relay emails. mynetworks: Specifies the network addresses that are considered part of the local network and are allowed to send email. 127.0.0.0/8 allows only the local system to send mail. inet_interfaces: Setting this to loopback-only makes Postfix listen only on the localhost interface, which is suitable for a send-only setup. inet_protocols: Set to ipv4 if you do not need IPv6 support.

Step 3: Restart Postfix After making changes, save the file and restart Postfix to apply the changes:

sudo systemctl restart postfix

Step 4: Test Email Sending Test sending an email with the mail utility:

echo "Test email body" | mail -s "Test Email Subject" your_email@example.com

Replace your_email@example.com with your actual email address.

Step 5: Check the Mail Log for Errors If the email doesn't seem to be sent, check the mail log for any error messages:

cat /var/log/mail.log

journalctl -u postfix

Then you need to setup cronjob

crontab -e

add this below line

/59 * * * * /home/ar/anrai/cs/speedtest_cronjob/check_speed.sh #will run after every hour
